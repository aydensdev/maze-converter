This project has 3 main functions:

Generate - generate a visual maze with the input text encoded
Decode   - import a .maze file and display the maze and its message
Export   - export the displayed maze as a .maze file

Essentially, the project replaces a maze generation algorithm's random decisions 
with the input data to get a valid maze.

While it successfully encodes the information, more work is needed to have it 
compress the data and retrieve it.
